            <pre>
                Ingredients:
                    • 2 and 1/4 cups (280g) all-purpose flour (spoon & leveled)
                    • 1 teaspoon baking soda
                    • 1 and 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch*
                    • 1/2 teaspoon salt
                    • 3/4 cup (1.5 sticks or 170g) unsalted butter, melted & slightly cooled*
                    • 3/4 cup (150g) packed light or dark brown sugar
                    • 1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar
                    • 1 large egg + 1 egg yolk, at room temperature
                    • 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
                    • 1 and 1/4 cups (225g) semi-sweet chocolate chips or chocolate chunks
                    
                Instructions:
                    1. Whisk the flour, baking soda, cornstarch, and salt together in a large 
                        bowl. Set aside.
                    2. In a medium bowl, whisk the melted butter, brown sugar, 
                        and granulated sugar together until no brown sugar lumps remain. 
                        Whisk in the egg, then the egg yolk. Finally, whisk in the vanilla 
                        extract. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix 
                        together with a large spoon or rubber spatula. The dough will be 
                        very soft, yet thick. Fold in the chocolate chunks. They may not stick 
                        to the dough because of the melted butter, but do your best to 
                        combine them. Cover the dough and chill in the refrigerator for 2-3 
                        hours or up to 3-4 days. Chilling is mandatory. I highly recommend 
                        chilling the cookie dough overnight for less spreading.
                    3. Take the dough out of the refrigerator and allow to slightly soften at 
                        room temperature for 10 minutes.
                    4. Preheat oven to 325°F (163°C). Line two large baking sheets with 
                        parchment paper or silicone baking mats. (Always recommended for 
                        cookies.) Set aside.
                    5. Roll the dough into balls, about 3 Tablespoons of dough each. The 
                        dough will be crumbly, but the warmth of your hands will help the 
                        balls stay together. Roll the cookie dough balls to be taller rather 
                        than wide, to ensure the cookies will bake up to be thick. Place 8 
                        balls of dough onto each cookie sheet. Press a few more chocolate 
                        chips/chunks on top of the dough balls for looks, if desired.
                    6. Bake the cookies for 12-13 minutes. The cookies will look very soft 
                        and underbaked. They will continue to bake on the cookie sheet. 
                        Allow to cool on the cookie sheet for 10 minutes before transferring 
                        to a wire rack to cool completely.
                    7. Cookies stay fresh covered at room temperature for up to 1 week.
